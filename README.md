1.Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
intially we analyse the data by using the visualisation tools like matplotlib,seaborn.
secondly we are clean the data fill the null values.
predict and train the  data by using the LogisticRegression.
at last we are going to predict the passenger is going to survive or not by using the pclass and sex in the program.

2.Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
techniques to tackle this problem.
The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
critics.
Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data
analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors
that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.
